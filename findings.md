# Consistently check account balance before and after transfers for Fee-On-Transfer discrepancies. As arbitrary ERC20 tokens can be used, the amount here should be calculated every time to take into consideration a possible fee-on-transfer or deflation. Also, it's a good practice for the future of the solution.Use the balance before and after the transfer to calculate the received amount instead of assuming that it would be equal to the amount passed as a parameter. Or explicitly document that such tokens shouldn't be used and won't be supported
